# What is Hot Potato Game Dev?
An exercise is collaborative prototyping. Each dev takes turns to try influence the direction and design of the game before passing it on to the next dev.

## What kind of changes can I make?
Whatever you like, but the goal is to make the biggest impact in the shortest amount of time. There are no hard limits on anything right now and I'd love to keep it that way.

## Can I undo someone else's change
As I said above, your change can be whatever you like, but I strongly encourage you to consider a change that lives harmoniously with the existing contributions.

# How do I contribute?
Add a new [Contribution Task](https://github.com/Geokureli/HotPotato/issues/new?template=contribution-task.md) to the queue! Be sure to check the check the [Existing Tasks](https://github.com/Geokureli/HotPotato/issues) before adding a potential duplicate. Once your task is marked as `Active`, it's go time!

# I love this idea but despise you, George; can I steal this Idea!
Yes! I would love to see Hot Potato projects pop up for other languages, engines and dev tools and in all sorts of communities!
